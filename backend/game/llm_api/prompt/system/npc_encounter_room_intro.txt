Generate a response in JSON format with these fields:
{
    "description": "A vivid 1-2 sentence description of the floor that sets the atmosphere and hints at its nature, followed by 1-2 sentences describing the NPC(s) with specific, sensory details. Avoid generic or repetitive words such as 'figure'; make each NPC distinct and memorable.",
    "investigation_hook": "A compelling 1 sentence prompt that invites the player to investigate the floor or interact with the NPC(s).",
    "suggested_actions": [
        "action1", // one short sentence
        "action2" // another short sentence
    ],
    "summary": "A concise 15-20 word summary of the key elements and mood of this scene."
}

Guidelines:
- Match the tone and style to the provided floor type.
- Keep all descriptions concise but evocative, using varied and specific language.
- Make the investigation hook engaging and interactive, encouraging player curiosity or involvement.
- [Optional] The hook should make the player feel their character's background is relevant to the current situation.
