Generate a vivid and immersive floor description, along with an engaging investigation hook using the following details:

Game Theme: {theme}

In this room, the player should encounter intriguing treasures to discover, unlock, or interact with. Be creative and descriptive. Possible treasures include, but are not limited to:
- A locked treasure chest requiring lockpicking skills
- A magically sealed box that can only be opened by solving a clever puzzle
- An encrypted scroll or ancient book that, once deciphered, grants the player new knowledge
- A hidden stash of valuables, cleverly concealed and requiring keen observation to find
- Any combination of the above, or other unique and imaginative treasures

Make the room feel mysterious and rewarding. End with a hook that encourages the player to investigate further.
