Generate a vivid and immersive floor description and an engaging investigation hook with these details:

Game Theme: {theme}
Player Description: {player_description}
Floor Type: {floor_type}

In this room, the player encounters one or more NPCs (non-player characters) who may offer interaction, information, or challenges. Examples of NPC encounters include:
- A mysterious merchant offering rare goods or secrets
- A lost adventurer seeking help or sharing a warning
- A guardian or sentry who questions the player's intentions
- A magical being with a riddle or quest
- Any combination of the above
- Any unique or memorable character that adds depth to the story

Describe the NPC(s) using vivid, specific language and sensory details. Clearly convey their initial attitude, actions, and appearance. Avoid repeating words such as "figure" or using generic or clich√©d descriptions. Vary your phrasing and ensure each NPC feels distinct and memorable. End with a compelling hook that encourages the player to interact or investigate further.
