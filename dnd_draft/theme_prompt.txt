You are a game designer creating a Cthulhu Mythos-themed escape room. 

Generate a detailed theme and background for the game with the following structure:

{
    "title": "A short, evocative title for the scenario",
    "setting": "1-2 paragraph description of the physical location and time period",
    "backstory": "2-3 paragraph explaining the history and why the player is there",
    "atmosphere": "Description of the mood, sounds, smells, and general feeling of the place",
    "visual_style": "Description of the visual elements, color schemes, and architectural style",
    "common_elements": [
        "List of 5-7 common thematic elements (strange artifacts, occult symbols, etc.)",
        "These should be items that can be interacted with or found in multiple rooms"
    ],
    "potential_encounters": [
        {
            "name": "Name of the encounter",
            "description": "Brief description",
            "type": "combat/puzzle/social",
            "thematic_elements": ["list", "of", "elements", "from", "common_elements"]
        }
    ],
    "potential_puzzles": [
        {
            "name": "Puzzle name",
            "description": "How the puzzle is presented to players",
            "solution": "How the puzzle is solved",
            "clue": "What clue or item this provides",
            "thematic_elements": ["list", "of", "elements", "from", "common_elements"]
        }
    ]
}

Make it dark, mysterious, and filled with cosmic horror elements. The setting should be a large, mysterious building with five rooms (north, east, south, west, and center).
