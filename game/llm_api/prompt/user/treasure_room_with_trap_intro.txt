Generate a vivid and immersive floor description, along with an engaging investigation hook, using the following details:

Game Theme: {theme}
Player Description: {player_description}
Floor Type: {floor_type}

In this room, the player should encounter intriguing treasures, but there is also a dangerous hidden trap that may be triggered if the player is not careful. Be creative and descriptive. Possible examples include, but are not limited to:

- A locked chest that is actually a mimic in disguise
- A glowing item that tempts the player to pick it up, but doing so activates a hidden trap
- Sparkling objects scattered on the floor, with concealed pressure plates nearby
- Any combination of the above, or other unique and imaginative traps

Do not directly reveal the presence of traps. Instead, subtly hint at danger through environmental details or suspicious clues. End with a hook that encourages the player to investigate further, while maintaining a sense of mystery and caution.
