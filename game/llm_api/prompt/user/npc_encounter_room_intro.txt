In this room, the player encounters one or more NPCs (non-player characters) who may offer interaction, information, or challenges. Examples of NPC encounters include:
- A mysterious merchant offering rare goods or secrets
- A lost adventurer seeking help or sharing a warning
- A guardian or sentry who questions the player's intentions
- A magical being with a riddle or quest
- Any combination of the above
- Any unique or memorable character that adds depth to the story

Describe the NPC(s) and their initial attitude or actions. End with a hook that encourages the player to interact or investigate further.
