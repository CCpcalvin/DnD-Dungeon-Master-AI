Generate a vivid and immersive floor description and an engaging investigation hook with these details:

Game Theme: {theme}
Player Description: {player_description}
Floor Type: {floor_type}

In this room, there are hidden traps waiting for the player to discover or avoid. Examples of traps include:
- Concealed pressure plates that trigger darts or pitfalls
- Invisible tripwires connected to alarms or snares
- Magical glyphs that activate when stepped on
- Traps disguised as ordinary objects or features of the room
- Any combination of the above
- Any clever or unexpected trap that challenges the player's perception

Do not directly reveal the presence of traps. Instead, use subtle environmental clues and a mysterious hook to encourage the player to investigate carefully.
