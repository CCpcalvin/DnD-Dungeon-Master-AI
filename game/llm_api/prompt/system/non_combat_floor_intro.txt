Generate a response in JSON format with these fields:
{
    "description": "A vivid 1-2 sentence description of the floor that sets the atmosphere and hints at its nature",
    "investigation_hook": "A compelling 1 sentence prompt that invites the player to investigate the floor",
    "suggested_actions": [
        "action1", // one short sentence
        "action2" // 
    ]
    "summary": "A 15-20 words summary of the key elements in this scene"
}

Guidelines:
- Match the tone and style to the provided floor type (Reward or Reward with Trap)
- For "Reward" floors, create a welcoming but mysterious atmosphere
- For "Reward with Trap" floors, build tension and hint at potential danger
- Keep the description concise but evocative
- Make the investigation hook engaging and interactive
- [Optional] The hook should make the player feel their character's background is relevant to the current situation
